-- | MCode to LLVM IR, for the subset the JIT supports. See design.md for
-- the conventions and internals.md ("The generator") for how this module
-- is organized.
--
-- Within a function, every Unison stack slot is an LLVM alloca (decision
-- D11): @%u<k>@ holds the unboxed word and @%b<k>@ the boxed pointer of the
-- slot at frame offset @k@, which is stack index @fp + k@. The frame depth
-- @d@ (the interpreter's @sp - fp@) is known statically at every point, so
-- MCode's "slot @i@ from the top" is frame offset @d - i@. The real stack
-- is touched only at entry, before a tail call, and on exit paths.
--
-- The generator is strict throughout (see "Unison.Runtime.JIT.Strict"):
-- its text is 'Text', its sequences are 'Deque's, its pairs are 'Pair's,
-- and every field of its state is strict, so nothing it builds is a thunk.

  -- interpreter's Haskell operation for operation (Machine/Primops.hs):
  -- compiled Haskell calls libm for exp, log, the trigonometric and
  -- hyperbolic functions, uses an instruction for sqrt and abs, and converts
  -- to Int with a saturating conversion (fcvtzs on arm64; NaN gives 0),
  -- which is what the saturating intrinsic lowers to. `round` is rint
  -- (half to even) then that conversion. `ceiling` and `floor` are
  -- GHC.Float's ceilingDoubleInt and floorDoubleInt: truncate, then add or
  -- subtract one (wrapping) if the remainder x - n has the right sign, which
  -- is not what a saturating ceil would give out of range, so it is done
  -- the same way here.
