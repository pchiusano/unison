-- | The foreign interface to LLVM, through the C shim in @cbits/jit_llvm.c@.
-- LLVM isn't linked in: the shim loads it with @dlopen@ when the JIT is
-- turned on ('initLLVM'), so that ucm builds and runs without LLVM, and the
-- JIT is unavailable, with a message saying where it looked, on a machine
-- that has no LLVM 20 or newer.
--
-- The shim is ours, over LLVM's C API, because the @llvm-hs@ bindings lag
-- LLVM releases and we need six functions. Modules are handed over as IR
-- /text/, which LLVM parses in memory: text can be built by string
-- building, read by a person and pasted into LLVM's command-line tools,
-- where bitcode is a bit-level stream only LLVM's own libraries write, and
-- building IR through the C API would mean many more foreign calls for IR
-- that can't be inspected without asking LLVM to print it. If parsing ever
-- shows in the compile times, the generator can be retargeted to the C API
-- without touching the code generator's logic.
